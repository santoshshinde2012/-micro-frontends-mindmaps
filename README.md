# Micro-Frontend Mindmaps

#### What

In this repository, you will find mindmaps we created about Micro-Frontend based on public information. As all of the information is already in the public domain, please feel free to use and share these mindmaps however you like.  

#### What is Micro-Frontend ?

Microfrontends are the technical representation of a business subdomain, they provide strong boundaries with clear contracts, also they avoid sharing logic with other subdomains

#### Micro-frontends decisions framework

The 4 pillars that we need to decide up-front when architecting micro-frontends, as stated by [Luca Mezzalira](https://github.com/lucamezzalira) here in his medium article - [Micro-frontends decisions framework](https://medium.com/@lucamezzalira/micro-frontends-decisions-framework-ebcd22256513).

```

#### Defining Micro-Frontends

Identifying micro-frontends becomes quite straightforward. Understanding how users behave is of great use in determining our micro-frontends. You can read Luca Mezzalira's full article [here](https://medium.com/dazn-tech/identifying-micro-frontends-in-our-applications-4b4995f39257) for more details.

#### Composition of Micro-frontends

Analyzing how different frameworks can be used with different micro frontends on the same page.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Composition of Micro-frontends]-->A1[Client-side composition];
  A[Composition of Micro-frontends]-->A2[Edge-side composition];
  A[Composition of Micro-frontends]-->A3[Server-side composition];
  A[Composition of Micro-frontends]-->A4[Build Time Composition];
```

##### 1. Client-side composition

Client Side Composition is one of the patterns that combine Fragments on client-side

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Client-side composition]-->B1[Fragments]
  A1[Client-side composition]-->B2[Libraries]
  B2[Libraries]-->C1[single-spa/single-spa]
  B2[Libraries]-->C2[frintjs/frint]
  B2[Libraries]-->C3[smapiot/piral]
```

##### 2. Edge-side composition
Basically its combination of client side and server side composition to take the advantages of CDN caching.
Idea behind edge-side composition – fragments are stitched together, close to the client. 

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Edge-side composition]-->B1[Lambda Edge]
  A1[Edge-side composition]-->B2[Rendering Example]
  B1[Lambda Edge]-->C1[AWS Lambda CloudFront]
  B2[Rendering Example]-->D1[Next js using Lambda Edge and Serverless Framework]
  B2[Rendering Example]-->D2[Cloudflare Workers using a framework called Flareact]
```


##### 3. Server-side composition
Pattern that assembles Fragments on the server side.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Server-side composition]-->B1[Layout Server]
  A1[Server-side composition]-->B2[Fragments Server]
  A1[Server-side composition]-->B3[Fragment Gateway]
  A1[Server-side composition]-->B4[Libraries]
  B4[Libraries]-->C1[Ara Framework]
  B4[Libraries]-->C2[OpenComponents]
  B4[Libraries]-->C3[Piral]
  B4[Libraries]-->C4[Tailor]
```

##### 4. Build Time Composition
Build Time Composition assembles Fragments at build time, not at client or server. Publish each micro frontend as a package, and have the container application include them all as library dependencies.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Build Time Composition]-->B1[Shared libraries]
  A1[Build Time Composition]-->B2[Static Site Generators]
  A1[Build Time Composition]-->B3[Bit]
```

#### Micro-Frontends Communication

There are sometimes UI fragments belonging to different teams that need to interact or communicate. When a user adds an item to the basket by clicking the buy button, other micro frontends such as the mini basket want to be notified to update their content accordingly. 

##### 1. User interface communication

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[User interface communication]-->B1[Parent to fragment]
  A1[User interface communication]-->B2[Fragment to parent]
  A1[User interface communication]-->B3[Fragment to fragment]
  A1[User interface communication]-->B4[Publish Subscribe with the Broadcast Channel API]

```

##### 2. Sharing state

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Sharing state]-->B1[Web Workers]
  A1[Sharing state]-->B2[Props and callbacks]
  A1[Sharing state]-->B3[Custom Events]
  A1[Sharing state]-->B4[Pub Sub library]
  A1[Sharing state]-->B5[Custom implementation]
```

#### Micro-Frontends Communication Patterns

##### 1. Parent to Fragment


```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Parent to Fragment]-->B1[Element Attributes]
  A1[Parent to Fragment]-->B2[Connected Callback]
  A1[Parent to Fragment]-->B3[Attribute Change Callback]
```

##### 2. Fragment to Parent

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Fragment to Parent]-->B1[Custom Events]
  A1[Fragment to Parent]-->B2[Event Listeners]
```

##### 3. Fragment to Fragment

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Fragment to Fragment]-->B1[DOM Manipulation]
  A1[Fragment to Fragment]-->B2[Attributes and Callbacks]
  A1[Fragment to Fragment]-->B3[Event Bus]
  A1[Fragment to Fragment]-->B4[Broadcast Channel API]
```

##### 4. Global Communication

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Global Communication]-->B1[URL Params]
  A1[Fragment to Fragment]-->B2[Global Context and State]
  A1[Fragment to Fragment]-->B3[State Management Libraries Redux]
```


#### Micro-Frontends anti-patterns

- Difference between micro-frontend and component
- Multi frameworks approach
- Write programs that do thing and do it well
- Dependency hell
- Unidirectional flow at the rescue
- Avoid organizational coupling
- Multiple micro-frontends calling same endpoint

#### Microfrontends with Module Federation

Module federation allows a JavaScript application to dynamically run code from another bundle/build, on both client and server.

- loading the module (asynchronous)
- evaluating the module (synchronous)

##### Why Use Module Federation?

- Better way to share code : Expose any code from any application that Webpack supports.
- Environment-Independent : Use shared code in different environment web, Node.js etc.
- Resolves Dependency Issues : Federated code defines their dependencies and if Webpack can’t find it in the scope, will download it.
